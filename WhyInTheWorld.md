## This is a markdown file

### With Sub Sub Headings

#### Which I have been trying to save for 3 days now


So Here is my conclusion:

You Do your work

When you want to publish it to the web, 

1) you build a space for it on the web (create repo)

2) You then build a space for it on your computer (clone repo)

3) Save the files you want in there

4) You mark up which you want to publish up
	<git add> or <git add .> for all files
	
5) Then you ask to have it committed
	<git commit -m "something explanatory">
	
6) Then you ask that you sync (if you are in GUI) or push if you are in shell

7) Things seem to be able to go both ways (just refresh and click reload frequently)


7) Then you finally relax and try to figure out how updates go through

9) Be perserverant in getting the work to cross through - trying to see how competition between updates get processed - sync away
